intro: |
  I've spent 10 years developing the skills to increase velocity,
  reliability, and quality for my employers and clients. These skills enable
  me to turn business requirements into production software, lead teams, and
  work effciently across the SDLC and stack.

  "You build it, you run it" is my mantra. Expertise in Ruby and JavaScript
  allows me to build web applications or backend services. Expertise with AWS,
  Bash, Docker, Kubernetes, and roll your own VMs allows me to create automated
  deployment pipelines to get software in production. Finally, applying DevOps
  and site reliability engineering practice ensure the entire process runs
  smoothly. I thrive in this feedback loop.

  I've shared knowledge about this feedback loop throughout my career. I've
  trained team members to follow the mantra through DevOps and site reliability
  engineering practices. I've written numerous continuous delivery tutorials,
  produced long form video course, and an entire email course on DevOps. In my
  view, one doesn't fully comprehend a subject unless they can explain it to
  someone else. Writing and teaching solidified my own understanding and, more
  importantly, spread the knowledge and skills to others.

  The industry labels my skills as "Full Stack Development", "Backend
  Engineer", "DevOps Engineer", or "Site Reliability Engineer". I don't pigeon
  hole myself because I'm a mix.  My skills allow me to pull the levers that
  generate the best business results if that means building a SPA, deploying a
  micro service, removing toil, or automating deploys. That's just all in a
  day's work to me.

  I'm searching for a remote and distributed (there's a difference) team
  because those teams tend to favor results over process. I'm confident I can
  drive business results and delight your customers with quality and reliable
  production software.
