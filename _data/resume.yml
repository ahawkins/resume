intro: |
  My goal is to help businesses succeed in software. This means accelerating
  delivery, increasing reliability, and fewer regressions. In my view, DevOps
  paired with the "you build it, you run it" mantra is the best methodology to
  achieve these results.

  I started building webapps with PHP and jumped to Ruby on Rails. I learned
  software engineering fundamentals like OOP, TDD, and software architecture
  through the Ruby community. Eventually I switched my focus to operations,
  infrastructure engineering, and continuous delivery under the broad Site
  Reliability Engineering umbrella. This provides me the necessary skillset to
  work wherever in the build-deploy-operate lifecycle.

  My ideal position is in a small distributed team where my decisions impact
  the business bottom line.

  On the personal side: I moved abroad in 2011 to work and travel the world.
  Since then I've lived in Finland, Germany, Sweden, and India while visiting
  many more before returning to the US in 2019. My hobbies are
  [travel](http://isos.ahawkins.me), reading, trance, hiking, and surfing. My
  preferred [dev setup](https://github.com/ahawkins/dotfiles) is MacOS, vim, a
  terminal, and my HD280's.
expertise:
  - title: Full-Stack
    description: |
      "You build, you run it" is my default mode. Expertise with
      [Ruby](https://www.joyofdesign.info) (and
      [Rails](https://railscaching.com)), JavaScript, Node.js, Bash, Docker,
      Kubernetes, and AWS means I can transform business requirements into
      running software.
      [TDD](https://www.slashdeploy.com/blog/2014/the-joy-of-teaching-tdd/) and
      continous delivery ensure quality. I gravitate more to backend services,
      but I've shipped Ember applications too.
  - title: Deployment Pipelines
    description: |
      Continous delivery underpins successful software teams. I've built
      [golden
      image](http://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/continuous-deployment-of-golden-images-with-packer-and-semaphore)
      pipelines, Docker orchestration prior to Kubernetes, [Helm
      charts](https://www.slashdeploy.com/blog/2017/building-our-helm-chart/),
      and custom pipelines for serverless applications. My preferred tools are
      Buildkite, Containers, Ansible, and Ansible.
  - title: Site Reliability Engineering
    description: |
      On-call, disaster recovery, infrastructure migration, new product
      launches, and system maintenance are just a few examples of SRE work.
      Primarily I focus on removing toil, improving developer tooling, and
      fostering and operations-thinking culture. I share [public
      postmortems](https://engineering.saltside.se/our-failure-migrating-to-kubernetes-25c28e6dd604)
      when I can.
  - title: Teaching
    description: |
      I've taught thousands of engineers how to build, run, and deploy their
      own applications through my blog and freelance writing.  My work covers
      software design and building deploy pipelines. I also created video
      courses on Docker, Kubernetes, serverless, and AWS best practices.  Refer
      to my [archive](https://www.slashdeploy.com/archive) for a complete list
      of posts, tutorials, conference talks, webinars, and video courses.
