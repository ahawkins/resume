intro: |
  I have 10 years of experience developing, deploying, and running web services
  mixed between remote freelance work and on-site fulltime employment.

  My goal is to accelerate software delivery, increase reliability, and
  eliminate regressions. My core competency is developing, deploying, and
  running cloud based web-services with DevOps and Site Reliability
  Engineering practices.

  I'm seeking remote employment as a Fullstack Engineer, DevOps Engineer, or
  Site Reliability Engineer.
background: |
  I started building webapps with PHP and jumped to Ruby on Rails. I learned
  software engineering fundamentals like OOP, TDD, and software architecture
  through the Ruby community. Eventually I switched focus to operations,
  infrastructure engineering, and continuous delivery under the broad Site
  Reliability Engineering umbrella.
skills: |
  TDD, CI/CD, AWS (CloudFormation/DynamoDB/EC2/S3/Lambda/and more),
  GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, Packer, Ansible, Bash, Ruby, Rails, Sinatra,
  Emberjs, TypeScript, Serverless, Vagrant, technical writing, git, PostgreSQL,
  MongoDB, Redis, Memcached, Fluentd, ElasticSearch, statsd, software architecture
bio: |
  I'm originally from the United States. I moved abroad in 2011 for work and
  travel. I have lived in Finland, Germany, Sweden and India before returning
  to the United States in 2019. Hobbies include
  [travel](http://isos.ahawkins.me), reading, trance, hiking, and surfing.
  MacOS, vim, a terminal, and HD280's is my preferred [dev
  setup](https://github.com/ahawkins/dotfiles)
expertise:
  - title: Full-Stack
    description: |
      "You build, you run it" is my default mode. Expertise with
      [Ruby](https://www.joyofdesign.info) (and
      [Rails](https://railscaching.com)), JavaScript, Node.js, Bash, Docker,
      Kubernetes, and AWS means I can transform business requirements into
      running software.
      [TDD](https://www.slashdeploy.com/blog/2014/the-joy-of-teaching-tdd/) and
      continuous delivery ensure quality. I gravitate more to backend services,
      but I've shipped Ember applications too.
  - title: Deployment Pipelines
    description: |
      Continous delivery underpins successful software teams. I've built
      [golden
      image](http://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/continuous-deployment-of-golden-images-with-packer-and-semaphore)
      pipelines, Docker orchestration prior to Kubernetes, [Helm
      charts](https://www.slashdeploy.com/blog/2017/building-our-helm-chart/),
      and custom pipelines for serverless applications. My preferred tools are
      [Buildkite](https://www.slashdeploy.com/blog/2019/cd-chatops-with-slack-buildkite/),
      Containers, and
      [Ansible](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/introduction-to-ansible).
  - title: Site Reliability Engineering
    description: |
      On-call, disaster recovery, infrastructure migration, new product
      launches, and system maintenance are just a few examples of SRE work.
      Primarily I focus on removing toil, improving developer tooling, and
      fostering and operations-thinking culture. I share [public
      postmortems](https://engineering.saltside.se/our-failure-migrating-to-kubernetes-25c28e6dd604)
      when I can.
  - title: Teaching
    description: |
      I've taught thousands of engineers how to build, run, and deploy their
      own applications through my blog and freelance writing.  My work covers
      software design and building deploy pipelines. I also created video
      courses on Docker, Kubernetes, serverless, and AWS best practices.  Refer
      to my [archive](https://www.slashdeploy.com/archive) for a complete list
      of posts, tutorials, conference talks, webinars, and video courses.
